I am a psychological researcher & tech developer passionate about the crossover of technology, people and entrepreneurship. Currently, I am taking this semester as a full-time Columbia student, studying Biostatistics. I really enjoy taking Data Science this semester.
Doing variety of sports and hanging out are my favorite ways of connecting with people. As a people person who is passionate about the crossover of technology, science, art and sports, I hope to create those like-wise meaningful experiences for others through implementation that I am good at! Seeing strangers getting connected is always the most rewarding to me :)
